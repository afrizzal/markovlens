# MarkovLens

## What This Is

MarkovLens is a multi-domain Markov chain forecasting workbench built as a BA/BI portfolio piece. It applies three Markov model formulations (m1 homogeneous, m2 time-varying, m3 extended) to two real business problems — brand market share forecasting and customer churn state modelling — backed by Monte Carlo simulation with empirical longshot-bias calibration.

The primary audience is BA/BI recruiters evaluating code quality, quantitative thinking, and engineering architecture. The secondary audience is the developer themselves, who needs it to be a genuinely useful analytical tool for real datasets.

## Core Value

A GitHub repo that convinces a senior BA/BI recruiter that the developer can think quantitatively AND ship a production-quality Python data product — two live domains, correct Markov math, clean 3-layer architecture.

## Requirements

### Validated — Phase 01 (Markov Engine, complete 2026-05-29)

- ✓ DATA-03: build_transition_matrix() — DuckDB GROUP BY → normalized NumPy matrix

### Validated — Phase 02 (Design System + Brand Share, complete 2026-05-30)

**Design System**
- ✓ UI-01: app/styles/plotly_theme.py — `register_theme()` + `app/styles/theme.css` full CSS design-token port (sequential heatmap ramp, categorical palette, churn state colors, utility classes)
- ✓ UI-02: Component library — `transition_heatmap` (BS-02), `monte_carlo_fan` (BS-03), `kpi_card` + `empty_state` with custom-HTML (D-06/D-07)
- ✓ BS-05: `compute_stationary()` in core/models.py — dominant left eigenvector via `scipy.linalg.eig(P.T)` with power-iteration fallback

**Brand Share Domain**
- ✓ BS-01: `domains/brand_share/service.py` — NumPy-only `BrandShareForecastResult` (14 fields), `run_forecast()` full m1/m2/m3 pipeline, `list_datasets()` brand_share-filtered
- ✓ BS-02: `transition_heatmap` component — annotated cells, fixed [0,1] colorscale, `⚠` sparsity markers at < 20 observations
- ✓ BS-03: `monte_carlo_fan` component — P10/P50/P90 bands (tonexty fill), `add_vline` historical/forecast separator, named legend
- ✓ BS-04: Model comparison — MAPE/Brier/log-loss for m1/m2/m3, `best_model` derived from measured accuracy (never hardcoded), interpretation paragraph
- ✓ BS-06: `app/pages/1_Brand_Share.py` — 4-tab forecaster (Overview, Transition Matrix, Monte Carlo, Model Comparison), control strip, KPI strip, loading/empty/error states; `@st.cache_data` gated

### Active

**Domain Services**
- [ ] SVC-02: domains/churn/service.py — orchestrate churn state modelling with Sankey + what-if

**UI (app/)**
- [ ] UI-03: app/Home.py — wired dashboard with KPIs from real forecasts/simulation_runs tables
- [ ] UI-04: app/pages/2_Churn.py — Sankey flow diagram + what-if state simulator
- [ ] UI-05: app/pages/3_Reports.py — PDF/CSV export of forecast results
- [ ] UI-06: app/pages/4_Settings.py — dataset management + upload interface

**Quality**
- [ ] TEST-01: Unit tests for ENG-01..ENG-10 (> 80% coverage for core/)
- [ ] TEST-02: Integration tests for data layer + DuckDB queries
- [ ] TEST-03: UI smoke tests — each page renders without error

### Out of Scope

- m4 (non-Markov, category-based) — complexity without portfolio payoff; deferred to v0.2
- Authentication / user accounts — single-user portfolio demo, no auth needed
- Real-time data streaming — static dataset analysis is the correct scope
- Multi-user SaaS features — not the product type
- External API integrations (Bloomberg, market data) — Kaggle datasets are sufficient for demo
- Mobile-responsive UI — Streamlit desktop is the target

## Context

**Codebase state (as of Phase 02 completion, 2026-05-30):** Markov engine + design system + Brand Share domain complete. 61/61 tests pass. `app/pages/1_Brand_Share.py` is fully wired — 4-tab forecaster with Plotly theme, all 3 model types, Monte Carlo fan chart, transition heatmap, model comparison, stationary distribution panel. Domain service is NumPy-only (no Plotly coupling). Churn domain service is still a stub; `2_Churn.py` not yet created. The project is ~55% complete.

**Mathematical foundation:** Chan (2015) *Market Share Modelling and Forecasting Using Markov Chains and Alternative Models*, IJICIC Vol.11 No.4. All model implementations must cite specific equations.

**Calibration source:** Becker (2026) empirical analysis of 72.1M Polymarket trades for longshot-bias correction. Do not modify calibration table without rerunning backtests.

**Deployment target:** Streamlit Cloud (free tier) — 1GB RAM, 1 CPU, no persistent background processes.

**Data:** Kaggle public datasets (telco churn, e-commerce brand share). Must work with real business data too — entity_id must be anonymized at ingestion.

**Portfolio positioning:** The GitHub repo IS the artifact. Code quality, architectural clarity, and correct math signal BA/BI-grade quantitative + engineering thinking. UI must be professional, not a class project.

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: 4 weeks hard — actively job hunting; must ship a compelling demo
- **Tech stack**: Python 3.12 + Streamlit + DuckDB + NumPy/Plotly — locked in, no migrations
- **Math**: All Markov implementations must correctly follow Chan (2015) — wrong math invalidates the portfolio story
- **Performance**: Streamlit Cloud 1GB RAM — Monte Carlo must use @st.cache_data; no 10k-sim cold starts on every interaction
- **UI polish**: Streamlit must not look like a student project — design system via theme.css + Plotly template required

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| DuckDB over SQLite | Columnar store, 10-100x faster for aggregations, native Parquet/CSV reading | — Pending |
| 3-layer arch (core/domains/app) | Testable pure functions in core; Streamlit isolated to app layer | — Pending |
| No Alembic migrations | Schema is additive; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS + manual scripts is simpler for solo dev | — Pending |
| np.random.default_rng over np.random.seed | Modern NumPy 2.0 API; reproducible per-simulation without global state | — Pending |
| LONGSHOT_CALIBRATION hardcoded | Becker table is empirically derived; requires deliberate update + backtest rerun to change | — Pending |
| Code quality over UI as primary artifact | BA/BI recruiters evaluate GitHub; professional UI is supporting evidence, not the headline | — Pending |
| Both domains in v1 | Dual-domain demo shows generalization of the Markov engine; single-domain weakens portfolio story | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
